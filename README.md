# advent-of-code-2020
Advent of Code 2020 code repository. This year, my language of choice was Python! To test, create an "Input.txt" file and paste the input you want the code to run. 
### Disclaimer: 
Since I was (sort of) aiming for the leaderboard, sometimes I had to prioritize time spent working over cleanliness of code. If you find yourself cringing at some redundancy or cut corner, odds are I am too. However, even if I were to go back and rewrite certain days, I'd rather display the code I created in the heat of the moment, even with the imperfections.
